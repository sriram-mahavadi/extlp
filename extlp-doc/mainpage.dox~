/** \mainpage Welcome to ExtLP

Optimization is an increasingly important task in various areas such as finance and engineering. The need to compute large scale linear programs is increasing with the complex functional requirements that are needed to be met for solving present real world optimization problems. When problems exceed reasonable dimensions, they end up in huge computational and storage requirements. Using external memory to
store and process such large problems turn out to be an efficient and cost-effective approach towards solving them.

This project aims at developing an linear program solver which implements an external memory supported version of an established revised simplex algorithm for solving large scale linear programming problems. The dimensions of the problems that can be solved by the other general linear program solvers is constrained by the physical memory of the system; a barrier definitively broken by the present solution.

In this thesis we shall define and evaluate different implementations of simplex which use external memory to solve large scale linear programs.

The estimated results show that the revised simplex implementation using PFI saves I/O by about 1000 times in comparison with tableau simplex using unpacked data structures and also saves I/O significantly in comparison with tableau simplex using packed data structures on a long run by maintaining good sparsity throughout the simplex process.
