/////////////////////// --------- Setting up the Project into NetBeans Environment

1. Install NetBeans
	-> For This install jdk
	sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre
	-> If both jdk-6 and jdk-7 are present choose jdk-7 as follows
	sudo update-alternatives --config java 
	-> Run netbeans shell script
2. Clone/Fetch the extlp project from online git repository
	-> Install git if not present already
	sudo apt-get install git0
	-> Cloning the project using git
	git clone https://github.com/sriram-mahavadi/extlp.git
3. IF git is giving any set of errors: see the links below
	https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey
	https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#step-3-add-your-ssh-key-to-github
	
3. Open extlp project using Netbeans
4. Install cmake if not present already
	sudo apt-get install cmake
5. Perform following commands for building the project
	got to project folder extlp and then execute the commands
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
	make
6. Add the .gitignore file into git 
6. Go back to Netbeans and check if clean and build is working fine
7. Copy/Fetch the Input folder for LP input from miplib2010 and soplex
8. Setting up the disks for stxxl 
	-> add .stxxl file into extlp/build/local directory having contents as follows:
		disk=/var/tmp/stxxl,20GiB,syscall
		disk=/media/Abhishek/stxxl,10GiB,syscall
		disk=/media/Sriram/stxxl,300GiB,syscall autogrow
		disk=/media/TOSHIBA\ EXT/stxxl, 300GiB, syscall autogrow
	-> We may precreate the disks to improve performance as follows:
	   Note that ./stxxl_tool is present in /extlp/build/tools directory
		./stxxl_tool create_files 20GiB /var/tmp/stxxl
		./stxxl_tool create_files 10GiB /media/Abhishek/stxxl
		./stxxl_tool create_files 300GiB /media/Sriram/stxxl
		./stxxl_tool create_files 300GiB /media/TOSHIBA\ EXT/stxxl
